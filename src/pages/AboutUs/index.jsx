              <p>
                Eric is a Senior at he University of Utah David Eccles School of
                Business studying Finance, Entrepreneurship, and Accounting. He
                was also inspired to start his own business due to working in
                poor work environments. Management was always giving him a hard
                time and making him hate the job. Even though he stuck out these
                jobs, he told himself that he didnâ€™t want to be in those kinds
                of environments ever again and that he wanted to work for
                himself so he could be his own boss and not have anyone
                disrespect him just because they are his superior in terms of
                their position in the office. Before launching this venture, he
                gained experience in the world of music promotion by helping
                some of his friends, who are musicians, run their social media
                pages and their marketing campaigns on these platforms.
